# NXP Build Instructions

## Dependencies

Please note, the libs folder below must contain libtofi_compute.so and libtofi_config.so. This folder and these two files are on the SD card image that is a part of the eval kit.

These are the ARM64 depth compute libraries. 

```
base folder
├── glog
├── libs
│   ├── libtofi_compute.so
│   └── libtofi_config.so
├── libwebsockets
├── protobuf
└── ToF
```

Other dependencies are already installed on the NXP.

## Building the SDK only

See [here](../../cmake/readme.md) for details on the cmake options.

### Pre-requisites
* CMake
* Glog v0.6.0
* Libwebsockets v3.1
* Protocol Buffers v3.9.0
* Depth Compute

### Installing the dependencies
* CMake:
```console
sudo apt install cmake
```

* Glog:
```console
pushd .
git clone --branch v0.6.0 --depth 1 https://github.com/google/glog
cd glog
mkdir build_0_6_0 && cd build_0_6_0
cmake -DWITH_GFLAGS=off -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/glog ..
sudo cmake --build . --target install
popd
```

* Libwebsockets:
```console
pushd .
git clone --branch v3.1-stable --depth 1 https://github.com/warmcat/libwebsockets
cd libwebsockets
mkdir build_3_1 && cd build_3_1
cmake -DLWS_WITH_SSL=OFF -DLWS_STATIC_PIC=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/websockets ..
sudo cmake --build . --target install
popd
```

* protobuf:
```console
pushd .
git clone --branch v3.9.0 --depth 1 https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf
cd protobuf
mkdir build_3_9_0 && cd build_3_9_0
cmake -Dprotobuf_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/protobuf ../cmake
sudo cmake --build . --target install
popd
```

* Depth Compute:

The Depth Compute library is required to build the SDK and run any application based on the SDK.
Based on the following scenarios you will be able to do the following:

1. You have the **arm development package for nxp** (libtofi_compute.so, libtofi_config.so) for the Depth Compute library. With it you will be able to build the SDK. The files should be included in the SD card image (~\Workspace\libs). You just need to put the files mentioned above in a directory called 'libs' which should be placed at the same level as the repository directory.

    If you prefer to keep the files somewhere else, you can tell cmake where to find them using the cmake variable: LIBTOFI_LIBDIR_PATH

2. You have no Depth Compute packages. In this case you can still build the SDK by enabling the USE_DEPTH_COMPUTE_OPENSOURCE option but you won't have access to the functionality that Depth Compute provides.

### Download and build SDK only

Please note, ensure you are using the intended branch.

```console
git clone --branch v5.0.0  https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/ToF
cd ToF
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DNXP=1 -DWITH_EXAMPLES=off -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/opt/glog;/opt/protobuf;/opt/websockets" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j4
```

### SDK with examples

Please note, ensure you are using the intended branch.

```console
git clone --branch v5.0.0  https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/ToF
cd ToF
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DNXP=1 -DWITH_EXAMPLES=on -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/opt/glog;/opt/protobuf;/opt/websockets" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j4
```
