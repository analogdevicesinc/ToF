1.0 RC5 Release Notes

Updates:
	1) Fixed register read bug where whitelist enforcement happens before 
	   the valid address check happens. 
           This caused a bug where if an odd number of registers are requested to be read, 
           the ROM will throw an error. This patch fixes ADO 3888. 
	2) Change in directory layout.

Production Flows:
    No changes.
