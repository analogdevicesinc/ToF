# Analog Devices 3D ToF software suite 

## Overview
The **ADI ToF SDK** is a cross platform library for the Analog Devices depth cameras based on the ADSD3100 TOF Signal Processor. It provides support for data processing on the embedded processor platform as well as for USB, Ethernet or Wi-Fi to connect to a host computer. This flexibility enables evaluation across a wide range of use cases and environments.

The SDK provides an API to control the ToF camera, IR stream and depth data. Windows support are built into the SDK as well as sample code and wrappers for various languages including Python and C/C++.

## SDK documentation

From an architectural point of view, the SDK consists of two layers. One layer is the high level API that allows clients to easily grab a camera object, configure it and request frames. The other layer is the low level API which exposes the interface through which low level operations can be made to the camera hardware.

**Known issues**

On a PC where Linux kernel version 5.13 is installed, a USB connected camera cannot be detected. The v4l device name that we expect is not being set properly. However it works for older and newer versions.
